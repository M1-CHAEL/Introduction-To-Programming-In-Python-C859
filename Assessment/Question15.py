""" Complete the get_num_of_characters() method to return the number of characters in the user's input string.

NOTE: Use of a for loop is recommended in this function

In main(), call the get_num_of_characters() method and then output both the original string and the returned result. Implement the output_without_whitespace() method, which outputs the string's characters except for whitespace (spaces, tabs). Call the output_without_whitespace() method in main().

NOTE: A tab is \t.

Ex: If the input is

The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.

the output is:

Enter a sentence or phrase:
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.

You entered: The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.

Number of characters: 46
String with no whitespace: Theonlythingwehavetofearisfearitself.
