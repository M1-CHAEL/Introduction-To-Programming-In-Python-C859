""" Driving is expensive. Write a program with a car's miles/gallon and gas dollars/gallon (both doubles) as input, and output the gas cost for 20 miles, 75 miles, and 500 miles.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print('{:.2f} {:.2f} {:.2f}'.format(dollars_20_miles, dollars_75_miles, dollars_500_miles))

Ex: If the input is:

20.0 
3.1599

the output is:

3.16 11.85 79.00

Note: Real per-mile cost would also include maintenance and depreciation.
